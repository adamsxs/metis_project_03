# Scania Truck Air Pressure System Diagnosis

This challenge was originally proposed at the [15th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida2016.blogs.dsv.su.se/)
in 2016 as the [Industrial Challenge](http://ida2016.blogs.dsv.su.se/?page_id=1387). 
Participants are given labeled training and test data that indicated whether or not the air pressure system (APS)
was the cause of failure for that truck, making it a binary classification problem. 
Models are scored on the testing data by minimizing a cost function that heavily penalizes Type II error. 
Training and test data can be found on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/aps-failure-at-scania-trucks-data-set/home).
