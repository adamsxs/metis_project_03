# Scania Truck Air Pressure System Diagnosis

This challenge was originally proposed at the [15th International Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis](http://ida2016.blogs.dsv.su.se/)
in 2016 as the [Industrial Challenge](http://ida2016.blogs.dsv.su.se/?page_id=1387). 
Participants are given labeled training and test data that indicated whether or not the air pressure system (APS)
was the cause of failure for that truck, making it a binary classification problem. 
Models are scored on a testing set, with the best scores achieved by minimizing a cost function that heavily penalizes Type II error.
Training and test data can be found on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/aps-failure-at-scania-trucks-data-set/home).  

The numbered Jupyter notebooks walk through the project from exploratory data analysis through visualization of results. 
Custom Python modules assist with data cleaning, model testing, and custom error metrics. 
Final slides can be viewed as a PDF in the images and presentation folder.
